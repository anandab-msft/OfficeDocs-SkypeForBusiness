# Microsoft Teams Information protection license report


The Teams Info protection license report gives insight into the apps which has [subscribed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/subscription?view=graph-rest-1.0) for [change notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/webhooks?view=graph-rest-1.0) events to listen to create, update or delete of messages at tenant level (i.e. /teams/getAllMessage or /chats/getAllMessages). A change notification corresponding to message is sent successfully only when user has the [required license](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-licenses).  You can see how many change notifications was triggered by a given user.
